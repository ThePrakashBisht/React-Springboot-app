# React-Springboot-app
This project is used for managing product, basically you can perform CRUD operation in this project. I have used H2  In-memory database for this project.

you need to download the zip files.
then you have to add dependencies of both backend and frontend.
after that run the project.

there is no need of any database, as this is an In-memory database based project

if any problem arises during running this code ypu can mail me on theprakashbisht@gmail.com  .

Thank You.
